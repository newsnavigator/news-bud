    Fake news is a widespread problem in the country, and it is vital that we make sure that we are informed in our society. According to a study from Pierce College, there were over 8.7 million engagements with fake news on Facebook. Given that weâ€™re in an election year, it is important to ensure that readers know what information is true or not. Our website, News Navigator, helps to filter the real and fake news and inform the users on what articles are clickbait or not. Our website classifies new articles based on URL and also summarize the articles.
